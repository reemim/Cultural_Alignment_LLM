  Cultural Alignment in Large Language Models: 
  An Explanatory Analysis Based on Hofstede’s Cultural
  Dimensions
</h1>



We propose an explanatory Cultural Alignment Test (Hofstede’s CAT <img src="images/cat_emoji.png" width="2%"/>) that gauges the cultural
misalignment of the LLM across each cultural dimension. This mechanism provides insight for
developing new strategies, potentially based on fine-tuning or other methods, to better align an LLM with specific
cultures.
